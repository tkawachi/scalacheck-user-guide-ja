# Stateful Testing

We have described how ScalaCheck can be used to state properties about isolated parts - units - of your code (usually methods), and how such properties can be tested in an automated fashion. However, sometimes you want to not only specify how a method should behave on its own, but also how a collection of methods should behave together, when used as an interface to a larger system. You want to specify how the methods - or commands - affect the system's state throughout time.

An example could be to specify the workflow of an ATM. You'd want to state requirements such as that the user has to enter the correct PIN code before any money could be withdrawn, or that entering an erronous PIN code three times would make the machine confiscate the credit card.

Formalising such command sequences using ScalaCheck's property combinators is a bit tricky. Instead, there is a small library in org.scalacheck.Commands for modelling commands and specifying conditions about them, which can then be used just as ordinary ScalaCheck properties, and tested with the org.scalacheck.Test module.

Let us now assume we want to test the following trivial counter class:

```scala
class Counter {
  private var n = 0
    def inc = n += 1
	  def dec = n -= 1
	    def get = n
		  def reset = n = 0
		  }
```

We specify the counter's commands by extending the org.scalacheck.Commands trait. See the comments in the code below for explanations on how Commands should be used:

```scala
		  object CounterSpecification extends Commands {
		  
		    // This is our system under test. All commands run against this instance.
			  val counter = new Counter
			  
			    // This is our state type that encodes the abstract state. The abstract state
				  // should model all the features we need from the real state, the system
				    // under test. We should leave out all details that aren't needed for
					  // specifying our pre- and postconditions. The state type must be called
					    // State and be immutable.
						  case class State(n: Int)
						  
						    // initialState should reset the system under test to a well defined
							  // initial state, and return the abstract version of that state.
							    def initialState() = {
								    counter.reset
									    State(counter.get)
										  }
										  
										    // We define our commands as subtypes of the traits Command or SetCommand.
											  // Each command must have a run method and a method that returns the new
											    // abstract state, as it should look after the command has been run.
												  // A command can also define a precondition that states how the current
												    // abstract state must look if the command should be allowed to run.
													  // Finally, we can also define a postcondition which verifies that the
													    // system under test is in a correct state after the command exectution.
														
														  case object Inc extends Command {
														      def run(s: State) = counter.inc
															      def nextState(s: State) = State(s.n + 1)
																  
																      // if we want to define a precondition, we add a function that
																	      // takes the current abstract state as parameter and returns a boolean
																		      // that says if the precondition is fulfilled or not. In this case, we
																			      // have no precondition so we just let the function return true. Obviously,
																				      // we could have skipped adding the precondition at all.
																					      preConditions += (s => true)
																						    }
																							
																							  case object Dec extends Command {
																							      def run(s: State) = counter.dec
																								      def nextState(s: State) = State(s.n - 1)
																									    }
																										
																										  case object Get extends Command {
																										      def run(s: State) = counter.get
																											      def nextState(s: State) = s
																												  
																												      // when we define a postcondition, we add a function that
																													      // takes three parameters, s0, s1 and r. s0 is the abstract state before
																														      // the command was run, s1 is the state after the command was run
																															      // and r is the result from the command's run method. The 
																																      // postcondition function should return a Boolean (or
																																	      // a Prop instance) that says if the condition holds or not.
																																		      postConditions += {
																																			        case (s0, s1, r:Int) => r == s0.n
																																					      case _ => false
																																						      }
																																							    }
																																								
																																								  // This is our command generator. Given an abstract state, the generator
																																								    // should return a command that is allowed to run in that state. Note that
																																									  // it is still neccessary to define preconditions on the commands if there
																																									    // are any. The generator is just giving a hint of which commands that are
																																										  // suitable for a given state, the preconditions will still be checked before
																																										    // a command runs. Sometimes you maybe want to adjust the distribution of
																																											  // your command generator according to the state, or do other calculations
																																											    // based on the state.
																																												  def genCommand(s: State): Gen[Command] = Gen.oneOf(Inc, Dec)
																																												  
																																												  }
```

Now we can test our Counter implementation. The Commands trait extends the Prop type, so we can use CounterSpecification just like a simple property.

```scala
scala> CounterSpecification.check
																			+ OK, passed 100 tests.
```
OK, our implementation seems to work. But let us introduce a bug:

```scala
class Counter {
																																												    private var n = 0
																																													  def inc = n += 1
																																													    def dec = if(n > 10) n -= 2 else n -= 1  // Bug!
																																														  def get = n
																																														    def reset = n = 0
																																															}
```

Lets test it again:

```scala
scala> CounterSpecification.check
																																															! Falsified after 37 passed tests.
																																															> COMMANDS: Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Inc, Dec, Get
																																															   (orig arg: Inc, Dec, Inc, Dec, Inc, Inc, Get, Inc, Inc, Get, Inc, Inc, I
																																															     nc, Dec, Inc, Inc, Inc, Get, Dec, Inc, Inc, Inc, Dec, Dec, Inc, Get, Dec,
																																																    Dec, Get, Inc, Dec, Get, Get, Inc, Inc, Inc, Get)
```

ScalaCheck found a failing command sequence (after testing 25 good ones), and then shrank it down. The resulting command sequence is indeed the minimal failing one! There is no other less complex command sequence that could have discovered the bug. This is a very powerful feature when testing complicated command sequences, where bugs may occur after a very specific sequence of commands that is hard to come up with when doing manual tests.
