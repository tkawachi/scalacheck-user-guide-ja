## What is ScalaCheck?

[ScalaCheck](http://code.google.com/p/scalacheck/)はScala及びJavaのUnitTestを自動で行なう為の，強力なツールです.

ScalaCheck is a powerful tool for automatic unit testing of Scala and Java programs. It features automatic test case generation and minimization of failing test cases. ScalaCheck started out as a Scala port of the Haskell library QuickCheck, and has since evolved and been extended with features not found in Haskell QuickCheck.
