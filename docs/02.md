# A quick example

Fire up the Scala interpreter, with ScalaCheck in the classpath.

```scala
> scala -cp scalacheck-1.7.jar
```

Import the forAll method, which creates universally quantified properties. We will dig into the different property methods later on, but forAll is probably the one you will use the most. Note that it was called property in earlier versions (pre 1.6) of ScalaCheck. property is now a deprecated method, since forAll is a much better name.

```scala
scala> import org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll
```

Define a property.

```scala
scala> val propConcatLists = forAll { (l1: List[Int], l2: List[Int]) =>
         l1.size + l2.size == (l1 ::: l2).size }
```

Check the property!

```scala
scala> propConcatLists.check
+ OK, passed 100 tests.
```

OK, that seemed alright. Now define another property.

```scala
scala> val propSqrt = forAll { (n: Int) => scala.Math.sqrt(n*n) == n }
```

Check it!

```scala
scala> propSqrt.check
! Falsified after 1 passed tests:
> -1
```

Not surprisingly, the property doesn't hold. The argument -1 falsifies it.
