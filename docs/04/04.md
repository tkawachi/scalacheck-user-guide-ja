## Generating Containers

There is a special generator, Gen.containerOf, that generates containers such as lists and arrays. They take another generator as argument, that is responsible for generating the individual items. You can use it in the following way:

```scala
val genIntList      = Gen.containerOf[List,Int](Gen.oneOf(1, 3, 5)

val genStringStream = Gen.containerOf[Stream,String](Gen.alphaStr)

val genBoolArray    = Gen.containerOf[Array,Boolean](true)
```

By default, ScalaCheck supports generation of List, Stream, Set, Array, and ArrayList (from java.util). You can add support for additional containers by adding implicit Buildable instances. See Buildable.scala for examples.

There is also Gen.containerOf1 for generating non-empty containers, and Gen.containerOfN for generating containers of a given size.
