## Conditional Generators

Conditional generators can be defined using Gen.suchThat in the following way:

```scala
val smallEvenInteger = Gen.choose(0,200) suchThat (_ % 2 == 0)
```

Conditional generators works just like conditional properties, in the sense that if the condition is too hard, ScalaCheck might not be able to generate enough values, and it might report a property test as undecided. The smallEvenInteger definition is probably OK, since it will only throw away half of the generated numbers, but one have to be careful when using the suchThat operator.
