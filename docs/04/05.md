## The arbitrary Generator

There is a special generator, org.scalacheck.Arbitrary.arbitrary, which generates arbitrary values of any supported type.

```scala
val evenInteger = Arbitrary.arbitrary[Int] suchThat (_ % 2 == 0)

val squares = for {
  xs <- Arbitrary.arbitrary[List[Int]]
  } yield xs.map(x => x*x)
```

The arbitrary generator is the generator used by ScalaCheck when it generates values for property parameters. Most of the times, you have to supply the type of the value to arbitrary, like above, since Scala often can't infer the type automatically. You can use arbitrary for any type that has an implicit Arbitrary instance. As mentioned earlier, ScalaCheck has default support for common types, but it is also possible to define your own implicit Arbitrary instances for unsupported types. See the following implicit Arbitrary definition for integers, that comes from the ScalaCheck implementation.

```scala
  implicit def arbInt: Arbitrary[Int] = Arbitrary(Gen.sized (s => Gen.choose(-s,s)))
```

To get support for your own type T you need to define an implicit method that returns an instance of Arbitrary[T]. Use the factory method Arbitrary(...) to create the Arbitrary instance. This method takes one parameter of type Gen[T] and returns an instance of Arbitrary[T].
  
  Now, lets say you have a custom type Tree[T] that you want to use as a parameter in your properties:
```scala
  abstract sealed class Tree[T] {
    def merge(t: Tree[T]) = Internal(List(this, t))
	
	  def size: Int = this match {
	      case Leaf(_) => 1
		      case Internal(children) => (children :\ 0) (_.size + _)
			    }
				}
				
				case class Internal[T](children: Seq[Tree[T]]) extends Tree[T]
				case class Leaf[T](elem: T) extends Tree[T]
```

When you specify an implicit generator for your type Tree[T], you also have to assume that there exists a implicit generator for the type T. You do this by specifying an implicit parameter of type Arbitrary[T], so you can use the generator arbitrary[T].

```scala
				implicit def arbTree[T](implicit a: Arbitrary[T]): Arbitrary[Tree[T]] =
				  Arbitrary {
				      val genLeaf = for(e <- Arbitrary.arbitrary[T]) yield Leaf(e)
					  
					      def genInternal(sz: Int): Gen[Tree[T]] = for {
						        n <- Gen.choose(sz/3, sz/2)
								      c <- Gen.vectorOf(n, sizedTree(sz/2))
									      } yield Internal(c)
										  
										      def sizedTree(sz: Int) =
											        if(sz <= 0) genLeaf
													      else Gen.frequency((1, genLeaf), (3, genInternal(sz)))
														  
														      Gen.sized(sz => sizedTree(sz))
															    }
```

As long as the implicit arbTree function is in scope, you can now write properties like this:

```scala
val propMergeTree = forAll( (t1: Tree[Int], t2: Tree[Int]) =>
																  t1.size + t2.size == t1.merge(t2).size
```
