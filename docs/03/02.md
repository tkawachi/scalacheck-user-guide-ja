## Conditional Properties

Sometimes, a specification takes the form of an implication. In ScalaCheck, you can use the implication operator ==>:

```scala
import org.scalacheck.Prop._

val propMakeList = forAll { n: Int =>
  (n >= 0 && n < 10000) ==> (List.make(n, "").length == n)
  }
```

  Now ScalaCheck will only care for the cases when n is not negative. We also filter out large numbers, since we don't want to generate huge lists.


  If the implication operator is given a condition that is hard or impossible to fulfill, ScalaCheck might not find enough passing test cases to state that the property holds. In the following trivial example, all cases where n is non-zero will be thrown away:

```scala
scala> import org.scalacheck.Prop._

scala> val propTrivial = forAll( (n: Int) => (n == 0) ==> (n == 0) )

scala> propTrivial.check
```

! Gave up after only 4 passed tests. 500 tests were discarded.
  It is possible to tell ScalaCheck to try harder when it generates test cases, but generally you should try to refactor your property specification instead of generating more test cases, if you get this scenario.
  
  Using implications, we realise that a property might not just pass or fail, it could also be undecided if the implication condition doesn't get fulfilled. In the section about test execution, the different results of property evaluations will be described in more detail.
