## Properties

A property is the testable unit in ScalaCheck, and is represented by the org.scalacheck.Prop class. There are several ways to create properties in ScalaCheck, one of them is to use the org.scalacheck.Prop.forAll method like in the example above. That method creates universally quantified properties directly, but it is also possible to create new properties by combining other properties, or to use any of the specialised methods in the org.scalacheck.Prop object.
