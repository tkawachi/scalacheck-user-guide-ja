## Combining Properties

A third way of creating properties, is to combine existing properties into new ones.

```scala
val p1 = forAll(...)

val p2 = forAll(...)

val p3 = p1 && p2

val p4 = p1 || p2

val p5 = p1 == p2

val p6 = all(p1, p2) // same as p1 && p2

val p7 = atLeastOne(p1, p2) // same as p1 || p2
```

Here, p3 will hold if and only if both p1 and p2 hold, p4 will hold if either p1 or p2 holds, and p5 will hold if p1 holds exactly when p2 holds and vice versa.
