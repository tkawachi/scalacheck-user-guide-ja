## Grouping properties

Often you want to specify several related properties, perhaps for all methods in a class. ScalaCheck provides a simple way of doing this, through the Properties trait. Look at the following specifications of some of the methods in the java.util.String class:

```scala
import org.scalacheck._

object StringSpecification extends Properties("String") {
  import Prop.forAll

  property("startsWith") = forAll { (a: String, b: String) =>
    (a + b).startsWith(a)
  }

  property("endsWith") = forAll { (a: String, b: String) =>
    (a + b).endsWith(b)
  }

  property("substring") = forAll { (a: String, b: String) =>
    (a + b).substring(a.length) == b
  }

  property("substring") = forAll { (a: String, b: String, c: String) =>
    (a + b + c).substring(a.length, a.length + b.length) == b
  }
}
```

The Properties class contains a main method that can be used for simple execution of the property tests. Compile and run the tests in the following way:

```scala
$ scalac -cp ScalaCheck-1.6.jar StringSpecification.scala
$ scala -cp ScalaCheck-1.6.jar:. StringSpecification
+ String.startsWith: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ String.endsWith: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ String.substring: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ String.substring: OK, passed 100 tests.
```

You can also use the check method of the Properties class to check all specified properties, just like for simple Prop instances. In fact, Properties is a subtype of Prop, so you can use it just as if it was a single property. That single property holds if and only if all of the contained properties hold.

There is a Properties.include method you can use if you want to group several different property collections into a single one. You could for example create one property collection for your application that consists of all the property collections of your individual classes:

```scala
object MyAppSpecification extends Properties("MyApp") {
  include(StringSpecification)
  include(...)
  include(...)
}
```
